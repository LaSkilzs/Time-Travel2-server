Although women eventually began to move into these areas toward the end of the century, blue collar work remained a male-dominated area."

Known as ""white collar"" jobs, men expanded to working in offices and commuting to get to their jobs. Wages were also higher in the business sector, so many men were able to provide more for their families if they held a job as a businessman.
