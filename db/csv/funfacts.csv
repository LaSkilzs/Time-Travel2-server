1,1,paragraph,"Even though the early 1900s are part of the Progressive Era, a majority of the working class didn’t experience the benefits of urban life. Many struggled to survive. The Library of Congress estimates that by 1904, one in three people living in the cities was close to starvation. Poor urban workers experienced overcrowded living conditions, dirty and poorly lit working conditions, insufficient clean water supplies, poor sewage methods and disease. The poor working class resided in slums and relied on low wages for basic survival. Many had a better standard of living as rural farmers in America or in their native homelands than in industrialized American cities."
2,1,paragraph,"There was an increase in the middle class during the beginning of the 20th century. A surplus of jobs and increasing wages, especially for skilled workers and small business owners who specialized in particular trades, resulted in a growing middle class in urban areas. Experienced, skilled workers often held leadership roles in factories and industrial plants. The middle class enjoyed leisure, shopping, amusement parks, stadium sports, movies and recreation -- entertainment and resources that rural workers weren’t privy to. Department stores, restaurants and improved transportation systems made city life exciting and enjoyable for those in the working middle class who had disposable income to afford such luxuries."
3,1,paragraph,"As women entered the workforce, dynamics of the working class changed. Women pursued college education, fair labor laws and increased political freedoms. Some women competed for jobs that had once been available only to male workers. New jobs in industrialized cities were especially appealing to single women who put off motherhood and marriage for independence and economic pursuits. As a result, the average family size dropped from seven children to four children from the 1800s to early 1900s."
4,1,paragraph,"The working class in industrialized cities consisted primarily of immigrant and native workers who labored at clothing factories, industrial plants and meat packaging facilities. Some also worked in lumberyards and shipyards that exported goods to other U.S. cities or across the Atlantic. Men, women and children worked in factories, often receiving pay that was incommensurate with their labor. In the early 1900s, labor unions petitioned for child labor laws, women’s workplace rights, better working conditions, fewer weekly work hours and higher pay, but it wasn’t until 1938 that the Fair Labor Standards Act was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. By 1900, 30 million people, comprising 30 percent of the U.S. population, lived in cities, according to the Library of Congress."
5,1,paragraph,"Farmers didn’t enjoy the cosmopolitan aspects of the growing, populous, industrial cities but their workload was just as taxing. Rural workers performed hard labor to ensure their crops and livestock survived, despite droughts, famines and pestilence. Farming was often considered part of the lower socioeconomic class because farmers lived simple lives, without luxury, fame or prestige. However, rural workers didn’t face the poor working conditions, unsanitary housing environments, poor sunlight, smoggy air and disease-infested close quarters that many of the poorer city-dwellers encountered. The rural population remained a majority until 1920."
6,1,sentence,Work in the factories was long and monotonous. 
7,1,sentence,"The average worker completed the same task, over and over, for at least 10 hours a day. Working long hours, six days per week contributed to extreme fatigue, illness and even injury. Children often worked even longer hours -- those who lived at the factory worked up to 18 hours a day. A call from workers for an 8-hour day began in the late-19th century. By 1914, Henry Ford was leading the charge with a scaled-back work week of only 40 hours from a previous 48-hour schedule."

12,1,sentence,The mechanization of the industrial age allowed businesses to replace skilled laborers in favor of unskilled workers for much less pay. 
13,1,sentence,"Paired with machines, large groups of unskilled workers were assigned to complete small portions of the manufacturing process. By assigning repetitive tasks to large groups, factories ""deskilled"" work and lowered wages."
14,1,sentence,"Though pay varied by gender and age, typical employees made about $6 a week, notes the American Postal Workers Union. This pay, at less than a living wage, forced workers into an endless cycle of poverty."
15,1,sentence,Half of all worker deaths occurred in two industries—coal mining and railroading.
16,1,paragraph,"For around $4 a day, you and your fellow ""Cowboys of the Sky"" would be risking your life everyday by going to work. With no harnesses or helmets, you would be expected balance atop skyscrapers and scale scaffolding, all the while praying for no surprise gusts of wind."
17,1,paragraph,"As a 1900's child care worker, you wouldn't have worked in a facility or centre, rather you would have lived in house with the family whose children you were taking care of. Only wealthy families in the 1900's could afford live-in servants or maids when they wanted a night out, so the upside is you would have lived in a nice house - with the downside being that you'd have to double as a servant."
18,1,paragraph,"If you were chosen to work on the Panama Canal in the 1900's, you'd be a part of history today. Firstly because it was one of the greatest engineering feats ever completed and secondly because the project was one of the deadliest of all time, resulting in over 30,000 deaths caused by either disease or injury from the working conditions. "
19,1,paragraph,"As a female teacher in the 1900s, you wouldn't have been allowed to marry or keep the company of men, hang out in ice cream shops, wear colourful clothing or smoke cigarettes. And in the classroom? Well you would have had your hands full with up to 60 children of all different grade levels in your class."

26,1,paragraph,"A lot of the facilities where people worked were unsafe. Typically the lighting was bad making it difficult to see. Many factories and mines were filled with dust that not only made it difficult to breathe, but could cause diseases including cancer. Other places were unsafe fire hazards where they dealt with flammable chemicals or fireworks. The smallest spark could set off a blaze or explosion. "
27,1,paragraph,"A lot of factories used child labor in unsafe conditions. Factories hired children because they worked for low wages. In some cases, they hired small children because they could get fit into places adults couldn't. "
