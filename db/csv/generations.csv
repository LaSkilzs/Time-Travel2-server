1,1900,progressive era,"Even though the early 1900s were a time when urbanization was growing like wildfire and cities were popping up all over the map, rural farming was still an important occupation of the working class. As factories and industries grew, farmers provided the food and agricultural resources that helped sustain life. The working class was often divided according to socioeconomic status with the wealthiest making up only a small percentage of the total labor force. Most of the working class struggled to make a decent living in factories, shipyards and farming communities.","During the late nineteenth century the U.S. economy underwent a spectacular increase in industrial growth. Abundant resources, an expanding labor force, government policy, and skilled entrepreneurs facilitated this shift to the large-scale production of manufactured goods. For many U.S. citizens industrialization resulted in an unprecedented prosperity but others did not benefit as greatly from the process. The expansion of manufacturing created a need for large numbers of factory workers. Although the average standard of living for workers increased steadily during the last decades of the nineteenth century, many workers struggled to make ends meet. At the turn of the century it took an annual income of at least $600 to live comfortably but the average worker made between $400 and $500 per year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Factory workers had to face long hours, poor working conditions, and job instability. During economic recessions many workers lost their jobs or faced sharp pay cuts. New employees found the discipline and regulation of factory work to be very different from other types of work. Work was often monotonous because workers performed one task over and over. It was also strictly regulated. Working hours were long averaging at least ten hours a day and six days a week for most workers, even longer for others. For men and women from agricultural backgrounds these new conditions proved challenging because farm work tended to be more flexible and offered a variety of work tasks. Factory work was also different for skilled artisans, who had once hand-crafted goods on their own schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The twentieth century opened with a great tide of immigrants arriving on the nation's shores. Between 1865 and 1915, approximately twenty-five million immigrants journeyed to America. This was more than four times the number that had come to the country during the fifty years before the Civil War (1861–65). Many of these arrivals entered the United States at Ellis Island in New York City, where they were processed, inspected, and checked for disease. Unlike the majority of the previous century's immigrant population, these people generally originated from southern and eastern Europe—Italy, Russia, Poland, Greece, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They spoke little or no English, often had minimal education, and lacked familiarity with American culture. Their reasons for coming were varied, but they all shared in the belief that America was the land of opportunity, where people could be free from political and religious persecution, own their own land, gain an education, and earn more than enough money."
